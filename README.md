# US-Election-Prediction-Model
This project predicts which political party will win in each U.S. county during the 2024 election. 

The model uses three datasets to make predictions: historical voting patterns from 2000-2020, 2024 betting odds for candidates, and 2024 favorability polls. Results are then compared with the county results from the 2024 election.
